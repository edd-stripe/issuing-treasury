# Stripe Banking-as-a-Service Sample Apps

This repository contains sample code to get you up and running with Stripe Banking-as-a-Service products, including Issuing and Treasury.

Check out whatever sample app best fits your BaaS hopes and dreams:

* **Embedded finance:** (`embedded_finance/`) An explanation of what this sample app is
* **Expense management:** (`expense_management/`) An explanation of what this sample app is

We need better text here!

You can also find the source code to Stripe's [BaaS Demo App](https://baas.stripe.dev) in `_base/`. Feel free to read the code for it, but you should probably look at the sample apps instead.
